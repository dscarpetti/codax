# codax

Codax is an idiomatic transactional embedded database for clojure. A codax database functions as a single (potentially enormous) clojure map, with a similar access & modification api.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/codax/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/codax)

Version 1.5.0 allows unsorted sets and maps to be used as [path](#paths) keys. It also reserves pathwise encoding codes `0xa0` - `0xaf`.

Version 1.4.0 implements [upgradable transactions](doc/upgradable-transactions.md). (using `with-upgradable-transaction` macro) and **fixes an RCE vulnerability**.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details on upgrading from earlier codax versions.

### The Why

Even simple programs frequently benefit from saving data to disk. Unfortunately, there is generally a large semantic leap once you go from values in memory to values on disk. Codax aims to close that semantic gap. While it won't win any speed contests, it is designed to be performant enough for applications serving thousands of users. Most importantly, it is designed to make data persistance as low friction as possible. It is also designed to be effortless to get started with. There are no external libraries to install, and the underlying B+ tree is written directly in clojure.

Fundamentally, I wrote this library for myself in an ongoing effort to make my own life simpler and my own programming more fun. I wanted to share it with the community in the hopes that others may find it does the same for them.

### ACID Compliance

Codax provides the following guarantees:

  - **Atomic** - Every transaction is completed fully, or not at all
  - **Consistent** - The database always represents a valid clojure map
  - **Isolated** - No reader or writer will ever see data from an incomplete transaction
  - **Durable** - All writes are synced to disk before returning

### Production Ready?

This library has been, and continues to be, successfully used in production environments.

If your project may eventually outgrow codax, keep an eye on [Dresser](https://github.com/Frozenlock/dresser), which can use codax under the hood and allows you to switch database backends later.

## Usage

### Basic API

*Note: all public api symbols have doc-strings which may provide additional details.*

**Database Functions**

  - `open-database!` - Opens or creates a database, or returns an existing database connection if it's already open
  - `close-database!` - Safely closes an open database
  - `close-all-databases!` - Safely closes all open databases
  - `is-open?` - Checks if a database is open
  - `destroy-database!` - Deletes a database and all its data _irretrievably_ (intended for use in tests).

**Transaction Macros**

These take a database argument and a transaction-symbol and bind the symbol to a newly created transaction. Transactions are isolated from each other. Read-transactions evaluate to the value of their body, but a (successful) **write-transaction evaluates to nil**.

  - `with-read-transaction` - creates a read transaction
  - `with-write-transaction` - creates a write transaction (body must evaluate to a transaction or an exception will be thrown)
  - `with-upgradable-transaction` - creates a read transaction that will upgrade to a write transaction if the transactions calls any modification function. Details and examples in [upgradable transactions.md](doc/upgradable-transactions.md). _added in 1.4.0_

**In-Transaction Functions**

These are all similar to the clojure.core map `*-in` (e.g. `assoc-in`) with the following exceptions:

  - their first argument is a **transaction** instead of a map
  - their second argument is a **path** (see below)
  - their value argument or result (in the case of update) must be [conformant](#conformant-values)

These must be called within a `with-write-transaction` or a `with-read-transaction` expression. Changes will only be persistent if `with-write-transaction` is used.

  - `get-at`
  - `assoc-at`
  - `update-at`
  - `merge-at`
  - `dissoc-at`

**Shortcut Functions**

These are the same as the transactional-functions except that their first argument is a **database** instead of a **transaction**. These are convenience functions which automatically create and execute transactions. The write variants will also return the result of the modification.

  - `get-at!`
  - `assoc-at!`
  - `update-at!`
  - `merge-at!`
  - `dissoc-at!`

**Seek Functions** _added in 1.2.0_

These allow you to get ordered subsets of data from the database "map" in the form of ordered key-value pairs. Each accepts optional `:limit` and `:reverse` keyword parameters. They follow the same naming conventions of the other functions (plain variants expect a `tx` argument and `!` variants expect a `db` argument).

  - `seek-at` & `seek-at!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided `path`
  - `seek-from` & `seek-from!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided path for keys >= `start-val`
  - `seek-to` & `seek-to!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided path for keys <= `end-val`
  - `seek-range` & `seek-range!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided path for keys >= `start-val` and <= `end-val`
  - `seek-prefix` & `seek-prefix!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided path for **string or keyword** keys which begin with `val-prefix`
  - `seek-prefix-range` & `seek-prefix-range!` - get ordered key-value pairs from the map at the provided path for **string or keyword** keys which begin with a value between (inclusive) `start-prefix` & `end-prefix`

See [Seek Examples](#seek-examples)

### Paths
A `path` is a vector of keys similar to the `[k & ks]` used in function like `assoc-in` with a few exceptions:

  - they are **limited to the following types**:
    - Symbols
    - Keywords
    - Strings
    - Numbers (float/double use is _strongly discouraged_)
    - true
    - false
    - nil
    - java.time.Instant
    - org.joda.time.DateTime
    - unsorted maps
    - unsorted sets
  - the path can only target nested maps, and **cannot be used to descend into other data structures (e.g. vectors)**.
  - you can get the empty path (e.g. `(get-at db [])` returns the full database) but you cannot modify it (e.g. `(assoc-at [] :foo)` throws an error)

If you need support for additional types, please review [doc/types.md](doc/types.md).

### Conformant Values

  - non-map values of any type serializable by [nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy)
    - _this will only be relevant to you if you are storing custom records or exotic datatypes. Out of the box, virtually all standard clojure datatypes are supported (i.e. you don't need to do anything special to store lists/vectors/sets/etc.)_
    - _the serialization is performed automatically, you **do not** need to serialize values manually_
  - maps and nested maps whose **keys conform to the valid path types** listed above
  - custom types may require whitelisting, see [#30](https://github.com/dscarpetti/codax/pull/30)

### Transactions

**Immutability**

Transactions are immutable. Each transformation (e.g. `assoc-at`, `update-at`) returns a new transaction, it _does not modify_ the transaction. Essentially you should treat them as you would a standard clojure map, one that you interact with using the `*-at` functions.

_Example:_
```clojure
(c/with-write-transaction [db tx-original]
  (let [tx-a (c/assoc-at tx-original [:letter] "a")
        tx-b (c/assoc-at tx-original [:letter] "b")]
    tx-a))

(c/get-at! db [:letter]) ; "a"
```

See the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) for examples of potential pitfalls.

**Visibility**

Changes in a transaction are only visible to subsequent transformations on that transaction. They are not visible anywhere else until committed (by being the final result in the body of a `with-write-transaction` expression). The changes are also not visible in any read transaction opened before the write transaction is committed.

_Example:_
```clojure
(c/with-write-transaction [db tx]
  (-> tx
      (c/assoc-at [:number] 1000)
      (c/update-at [:number] inc)))

(c/get-at! db [:number]) ; 1001

```

**Exceptions**

If an Exception is thrown within a `with-write-transaction` expression, the transaction is aborted and no changes are persisted.

**Locking**

Write transactions block other write transactions (though they do not block read transactions). It is best to avoid doing any computationally complex or IO heavy tasks (such as fetching remote data) inside a `with-write-transaction` block. See [Performance](#performance) for more details.


## Examples

``` clojure
(require [codax.core :as c])
```

### Simple Use
``` clojure

(def db (c/open-database! "data/demo-database")) ;

(c/assoc-at! db [:assets :people] {0 {:name "Alice"
                                      :occupation "Programmer"
                                      :age 42}
                                   1 {:name "Bob"
                                      :occupation "Writer"
                                      :age 27}}) ; {0 {:age 42, :name "Alice", ...}, 1 {:age 27, :name "Bob", ...}}

(c/get-at! db [:assets :people 0]) ; {:name "Alice" :occupation "Programmer" :age 42}

(c/update-at! db [:assets :people 1 :age] inc) ; 28

(c/merge-at! db [:assets] {:tools {"hammer" true
                                   "keyboard" true}}) ; {:people {...} :tools {"hammer" true, "keyboard" true}}

(c/get-at! db [:assets])
;;  {:people {0 {:name "Alice"
;;               :occupation "Programmer"
;;               :age 42}
;;            1 {:name "Bob"
;;               :occupation "Writer"
;;               :age 28}}
;;   :tools {"hammer" true
;;           "keyboard" true}}

(c/close-database! db)
```

(defn get-recent-messages [n]
  (-> (c/seek-at! db [:messages] :limit n :reverse true)
      process-messages ;;
      reverse)); we reverse the result because we want the messages to be in chronological order
               ; but we needed to use the :reverse seek parameter to prevent collecting all

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why aren't all my changes being saved?**

Because transactions are immutable, if an updated transaction is discarded, the transformations it contains will not be committed.

_Incorrect:_
```clojure
(c/with-write-transaction [db tx]
  (c/assoc-at tx [:users 1] "Alice") ; this write is "lost"
  (c/assoc-at tx [:users 2] "Bob"))

(c/get-at! db [:users]) ; {2 "Bob"}
```

_Correct:_
```clojure
(c/with-write-transaction [db tx]
  (-> tx ; thread the transaction through multiple transformations
      (c/assoc-at [:users 1] "Alice")
      (c/assoc-at [:users 2] "Bob")))

(c/get-at! db [:users]) ; {1 "Alice" 2 "Bob"}
```

**Why am I getting a NullPointerException in my Write Transaction?**

A common cause is that the body of the `with-write-transaction` form is not evaluating to (returning) a transaction.

_Incorrect:_
```clojure
(defn init-counter! []
  (c/with-write-transaction [db tx]
    (when-not (c/get-at tx [:counter])
      (c/assoc-at tx [:counter] 0))))

(init-counter!) ; nil (it works the first time)
(init-counter!) ; java.lang.NullPointerException (the body evaluates to nil)

```

_Correct:_
```clojure
(defn init-counter! []
  (c/with-write-transaction [db tx]
    (if-not (c/get-at tx [:counter])
      (c/assoc-at tx [:counter] 0)
      tx))) ;; if the counter is already initialized, return the unmodified transaction

(init-counter!) ; nil
(init-counter!) ; nil

```

## Performance

_Codax is geared towards read-heavy workloads._

  - Read-Transactions block _nothing_
  - Write-Transactions block other Write-Transactions
  - Stage-1 Compaction blocks Write-Transactions (slow)
  - Stage-2 Compaction blocks both Reader-Transactions and Write-Transactions (fast)


### Benchmark Results

**Jan 14, 2017**

The following figures are for a database populated with 16,000,000 (map-leaf) values running on a Digital Ocean 2-core 2GB RAM instance. The write transactions have an average "path" length of 6 and an average 7 leaf values.

  - ~320 write-transaction/second
  - ~1640 read-transactions/second
  - ~2700ms per compaction (compaction happens automatically every 10,000 writes)

This benchmark is a bit dated, but a similar benchmarking function is available as `codax.bench.performance/run-benchmark`.
